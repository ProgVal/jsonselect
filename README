You can find more information here http://jsonselect.org/


## Project status

jsonselect.py currently implements levels 1 & 2 of these conformance tests https://github.com/lloyd/JSONSelectTests

level 3 is unimplemented because I was having trouble understanding what the correct behavior should be


##Tests

get the upstream conformance tests:
git submodule update --init

Run specific level conformance tests with
nosetests -m '.*_level_1' ./tests/test_conformance.py
